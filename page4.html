 			<p>The first of the three music videos is related to the DO levels in water (more on DO later). The music video follows the lawsuit against a factory owner because a fish's father passed away due to the mischevious actions of the factory owner. The factory owner did something to the water from the factory that emptied into the fish's river, which in turn caused the fish's father to perish.</p>

 			<p>The fish's main argument is that the amount of DO in the water dropped due to the factory using the water as coolant. DO refers to "Dissolved Oxygen" which is the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water that the fish use to breathe. Adding heat to the water causes the solubility to decrease, which causes the DO to go out of the water. Adding heat to the water also makes the metabolism of the fish higher, causing them to use more DO, which is lessening the supply of DO even further. </p>

 			<p>However, the factory owner claims that he cooled the water before putting it into the river, which would prove the fish's argument wrong. The fish's argument relied on the fact that the owner put hot water into the river, but the owner cooled his water beforehand. However, the fish realizes that although the factory owner did cool the water, the DO levels of the water were not replenished.</p>

 			<p>The factory owner had hot water, in which would cause the DO to get out of the water. After cooling the water, the factory owner did not put the DO back into the water, causing lesser DO levels in the river over time. This is what killed the fish's father, winning the fish the case against ther factory owner and getting justice. </p>

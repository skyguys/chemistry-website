			<p>We ran multiple experiments in class concerning the the effects of soap on milk and
				water. We got to see the different effects that soap had on surface tension in both
				of these two scenarios. In these experiments, we saw soap make beautiful food coloring
				art in a puddle of milk and on the other hand completely destroy anything trying to rest
				on top of water.</p>

				<p>For our experiment, we put milk onto a styrofoam plate and put food coloring into 
				four different ends of the plate, having blue, red, green, and yellow. We then 
				returned the food coloring to Pb. We received liquid soap, and upon doing so, we 
				dropped the food coloring into the middle of the plate. We observed the liquids
				moving around, mixing the different colors into a swirl of beautiful colors. It was
				quite a pretty reaction. We also observed the difference between whole in skim milk, 
				each showing a drastically different blend of colors. How does this happen? How does 
				adding liquid soap to milk cause the liquids to blend?</p>

				<p>How does soap cause such a pretty reaction?? It is the structure of the soap that 
				allows it to blend all of the food coloring together. The molecules of soap have a
				hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head. This structure is what allows soap to clean.
				It is also what allows this amazing reaction to occur. After forming micelles 
				(spheres of hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic tails with the heads on the outside 
				and the tails on the inside), the hydrophobic tails attract the non polar fat molecules 
				and break them down. The micelles then hit the fat molecules, initiating the reaction. </p>

				<p>After the reaction begins, soap molecules "chase" the fat molecules in the 
				food colouring all over the plate of milk, causing the colors to blend and swirl.
				This typically isn't visible to the naked eye, but with the help of food colouring,
				you can clearly observe what is happening (even if you don't understand). As the 
				soap finishes blending with the milk, this reaction slows down and eventually
				ceases. The more fat there is in the milk, the better the colours turn out to be
				and the longer the reaction lasts because there is more fat for the soap molecules
				to "chase" the fat. Therefore, this reaction would be much better in whole milk
				rather than skim milk.</p>

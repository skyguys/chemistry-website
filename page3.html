 			<p>We use soap daily to cleanse ourselves of filth and grime that comes to
			exist on our skin. But how do they exactly work? These everyday objects that
			seem simple on the outside are actually much more complicated then they look
			and work in an interesting and fascinating way. The properties and of soap
			allows for soap to function the way it does and make our skin sparkle.</p>

 			<p>The formula for soap can be written as <a class="italics">NaCH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>CO<sub>2</sub></a>
					where n is equal to 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16. This negatively charged front part
					or the "head" of the soap gives it hydrophillic properties which means
					that it absolutely loves water while the back or "tail" section of the soap is composed of a long carbon chain that
					gives it hydrophobic properties. While the head loves water, it hates oil, and while the tail loves oil, it hates
					water. <a class="italics"> Chemical Schizophrenia!</a> </p>

 			<p>When oil, dirt, and other stains stain our skin and clothing, the magic properties of soap allow us
			to destroy and remove those stains. Refering to the paragraph above, the hydrophobic
			tails of the soap molecules are always looking for some nonpolar molecule to stick to. For example,
			it'll often look for nonpolar dirst, grease, or oils and surround them with their tails. Multiple soap
			molecules tug on the oil molecule removing it from the cloth or skin it tries so
			hard to stick onto. When multiple soap molecules completely incase a nonpolar molecule, it is called a micelles.
			This can be followed up with agitation to assist soap even further
			in the removal of stains.</p>

 			<p>In conclusion, water alone is not enough to remove the filth from our skins.
				While it does dissolve lots of unwanted substances, it can not remove nonpolar
				molecules. Therefore, it needs the assistance of soap to make sure ALL of the unwanted
				stains are removed.</p>

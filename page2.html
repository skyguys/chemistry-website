 			<p>In our series of experiments, we did serveral experiments testing how soap
			"killed" the surface tension of water. In our first experiment, we witnessed
			soap pop surface tension in a cup, causing the water to overflow over the
			edge of the cup. In the other test that we did, we saw the surface tension
			in the cup suddenly cause a staple to sink to the bottom of the cup and
			a toothpick to float after dripping a bit of soap into the cup. This may be
			cool, but how does this happen?

 			<p>First of all, what is surface tension? Surface tension is a thin film over
			liquid caused by the liquid itself. The film is formed through the attractions
			of the particles on the surface of the liquid. Due to this, the surface area of
			the liquid is minimized. Water has a naturally high surface tension, explaining
			many day to day phenomenons. Surface tension is what causes water to form small
			little sphere-like drops of water rather than spread itself out all over a
			surface. This explains why water seems to combine into large little droplets
			on your car window. Surface tension is also the reason why belly flops hurt
			so much. The surface tension has likely not yet been broken and therefore feels
			like a solid surface rather than a liquid.</p>

 			<p>Why does soap kill surface tension? It is the structure of the soap that allows
			it to destroy the thin film on the surface of water. The molecules of soap have a
			hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head. This structure is what allows soap to clean.
			However, it is this structure that also weakens the attractions of the water
			molecules. The hydrophobic tail tries to move away from the water and ends up on the
			surface of the water. The soap molecules weaken the hydrogen bonds keeping the water
			molecules together, therefore greatly weakening surface tension. Soap is not the only
			thing that could break surface tension, but other household items, detergent being an
			example, can do this as well.</p>

 			<p>In the first experiment, we put a single drop of liquid soap into a full cup
			of water about to overflow. After the drop of soap hit the water, in just a few
			seconds, the surface tension broke and the water overflowed over the edge of
			the water. The hydrogen bonds were weakened so the barrier of water causing
			surface tension was destroyed, thus causing the cup to overflow. In the second
			experiments, we put a single drop of liquid soap into a half-full cup of water
			with a bug, staple, and wooden toothpick in it, which were resting on the water's
			surface tension. When the soap came into contact with the water, nothing happened
			at first due to the failure of soap to mix immediately. In this experiment, one
			may even need to mix the water and soap for a bit for this effect to occur. After
			the changes took place, the staple sank to the bottom of the water while the
			toothpick sank a bit and then began to float. The bug struggled to remain afloat,
				but eventually fell to the bottom of the cup with the staple. </p>
		 <br>
		 <br>
		<p> The reason why this would be detrimental in a normal environment (such as a lake) is because some bugs rely on the surface
		 tension of water to stay afloat. These bugs might unexepectedly sink to the bottom and possibly drown,
		 which would disrupt the ecosystem. In a food chain, if these bugs are one of the main food sources, this
		 could lead to an entire ecosystem collapse. This would be one example of human interaction with the
		 environment, causing an ecosystem to change. We also see this in the DO levels and the fish (more on this later)</p>

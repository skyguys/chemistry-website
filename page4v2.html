 			<p>The second of the three music videos is related to the the properties of water. We start off with some basics: Water is the universal solvent (which means that water dissolves many substances) and we also are told that "Sugar and alcohol both dissolve in it but these are not lit". What does this even mean?</p>

 			<p>They are referring to the conductivity of water. Pure water (such as bottled water) by itself is not conductive at all. If you had a tub of pure water and dropped a plugged-in item into the tub, you wouldn't get shocked. However, we are told not to have anything plugged near the bathtub because bathwater is tap water, not pure water. Tap water will shock you if any form of electrical current goes through it, but pure water will not. So what makes tap water different?</p>

 			<p>Tap water has many dissolved particles in it, as it is the universal solvent and dissolves many things. These particles are what make water conductive, not the water itself. Adding something like salt to pure water will make the pure water conductive, because of the ions from the salt having an electrical charge. Adding something like sugar or alcohol will not make pure water conductive, as sugar is not an ionic compound, and does not hold a charge. </p>

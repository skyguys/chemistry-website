 			<p>The third of the three music videos is related to turbidity. Turbitiy is how cloudy a substance is and can be a measure of how many particles are dissolved in a substance. Turbidity isn't always necessarily bad, but it isn't also necessarily good, as turbid water may serve as a good environment for microorganisms to grow in.</p>

 		<div id="text2">
 			<p>To seperate the particles in a solution, we can add a coagulant, which helps clarify the water by clumping the particles together. One coagulant like pool water works by finding small particles and having the coagulant bind to the particle, causing the particle to become bigger and be more easily picked up and filtered, causing a clearer looking pool. However, pool clearer takes a while to work, so we can speed everything up with a centrifuge.</p>

 		</div>
 		<div id="text1">
 			<p>A centrifuge is used to speed up the process of extracting the particles from the solution by spinning the solutions rapidly. For example, we added a coagulant, vinegar, to milk, and put it into the centrifuge. Some solutions can have their particles seperated physically by just spinning such as the cocoa powder in chocolate milk or the pulp in orange juice. </p>

 		<div id="text2">
 			<p>After letting the centrifuge spin for a while, we observed the changes that happened. In the vinegar milk, the milk turned into a slimy blob, while in the chocolate milk, the cocoa powder was settled at the bottom and the milk itself was not as brown. The orange juice had the pulp resting on the bottom aswell, which is also how some companies get no-pulp orange juice, by using a centrifuge. </p>
